# variable:
age = 24
name = "Wally"
print(f'my name is {name} and i have {age} years.')

age = 25
name = "Wally"
print(f'my name is {name} and i have {age} years.')

# python have no const but we can use convention, use a variable with first capital letter:
ABS_PATH = 'home/etc/bla/bla/bla'

# Good Pratices
#1 - names use snake_case
#2 - choose suggestive names
#3 - Constant names in all uppercase
